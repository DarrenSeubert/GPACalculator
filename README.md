# GPACalculator

A command-line GPA calculator designed for the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s unique grading system. This program allows users to calculate both semester and cumulative GPA by entering previous academic information and current class details.

During my freshman year, I couldn’t find a GPA calculator that supported UW-Madison’s unconventional grading system (even though one exists [here](https://gpacalc.ls.wisc.edu/)), so I created this program. Over my time in school, I continued to enhance it, adding new features and improving its functionality. While the code may not be the cleanest, it offers robust error handling and a user-friendly experience.

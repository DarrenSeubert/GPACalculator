# GPACalculator
A program that can calculate a user's GPA at the University of Wisconsin-Madison given previous GPA and current class letter grades.

I initally created this program in my dorm room, freshman year of college while taking a entry level Computer Science course. I could not find an online GPA Calculator for the University's weird grading system (even though one exists [here](https://saa.ls.wisc.edu/policies-forms-2/probation/gpa-calculator/)) so I made this program. It is more complicated then it needs to be with invalid input handling. I also only created it with one class and very few methods (a choice that I will probably change in the future). This project has now turned into one I add to every semster or so, making small improvments as I go. It is not the cleanest or easiest code to follow, but I am proud of all of the error handling within it.
